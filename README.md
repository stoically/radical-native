## Install

### 1. Radical Native

- Ubuntu/Debian: [Install with the latest released `.deb` file](https://github.com/stoically/radical-native/releases)
- MacOS: [Install with the latest released `.pkg` file](https://github.com/stoically/radical-native/releases)
  - Note: Requires Ctrl+Click on the `.pkg` since the installer isn't signed yet
- Windows: [Install with the latest released `.exe` file](https://github.com/stoically/radical-native/releases)

Hint: The event store is saved into the `radical-native` directory inside your [local user data directory](https://github.com/soc/dirs-rs#features).

### 2. Radical Native Add-on

- [Install the Firefox Add-on from the latest released `.xpi` file](https://github.com/stoically/radical-native/releases)

The Radical Native Firefox Add-on facilitates the communication between Riot Web and the Radical Native Binary.

## Usage

- Open any Riot website in your browser
- Click the Radical Native icon in the toolbar (RAM icon)
- Riot website should reload and the toolbar icon should have an "on" badge
- Check Riot's "Settings > Security & Privacy > Message search > Manage", it should show ongoing work

## Troubleshooting

- Try to execute the `radical-native` binary directly - it should respond with "ready: true"
- Check the Radical Native Add-on console for error logs: `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox` > Radical Native Inspect
- If indexing gets stuck you can safely disable and enable it in the "Manage" dialog
